# QuiltMC Mod Dependency Overrides (quilt-loader-overrides.json)

This subfolder contains all JSON schemas for the quilt-loader-overrides.json file.

It is recommended to use the [main JSON schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QuiltMC/quilt-json-schemas/main/quilt-loader-overrides.json/schemas/main.json) since it's guaranteed to be future-proof.

The QuiltMC Mod Dependency Overrides v1 JSON Schema is based on the [corresponding code in Quilt Loader](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilt-loader/blob/develop/src/main/java/org/quiltmc/loader/impl/metadata/qmj/QuiltOverrides.java).
